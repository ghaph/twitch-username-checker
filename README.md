## Setup

-   Make sure python is installed
-   Run `pip install requests` if you don't already have it installed
-   Put your names list file next to `checker.py`. Make sure its called `names.txt`
-   Now open checker.py.
-   It will then check all the names in your list and write all available names to `available.txt`

## Info

This isn't the most efficent checker but due to Twitch's extremely lenient rate limit you can check around 10k names every minute
